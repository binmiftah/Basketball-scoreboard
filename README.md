**Basketball Scoreboard App**

Hi there, this app was given as a basic JavaScript challenge from Scrimba's free JavaScript course.

I built this simple scoreboard from scratch i.e HTML, CSS and JS. This app features a manual scoreboard that allows you inrement the score of each team by 1, 2 or 3 depending on the rules of the game.

The two teams are Home and Guest. When the score of one team is higher than that of the other, it becomes a blue colour. If the scores are equal it both scores are at default colour. This was achieved using js event listener.

It also has a reset button that resets the scores back to zero. The font I used for the score is called "Cursed Time ULiL".

Try it and see if it's good. I'd love to see your comments.
